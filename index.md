### Brief Bio
I am currently pursuing my Masters degree in Financial Technology at the University of Cape Town. I chose this field of study because I am genuinely curious about leveraging the applications of data science and blockchain technology to create innovative financial products.

I believe that the benefits of higher financial inclusion from successful implementation of fin tech will bring Africa to its next frontier of development. I am very excited to be apart of creating this future.
